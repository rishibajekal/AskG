## Background
A surprisingly large number of average users of search engines have been found to use full English language questions as queries for search engines. For example, to find why one's car is not starting, a layperson may type "Why is my car not starting?". Large-scale search engines, like Google or Bing, may be able to handle this to a certain extent, but struggle to deliver high-quality results when the query becomes a full sentence with multiple clauses.

## Goal
The goal of AskG is to decompose a full English language question into optimized queries to ultimately create a better search experience for the average user.
